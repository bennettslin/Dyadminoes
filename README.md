Dyadminoes
==========

A musical tile game I created that is best described as a cross between dominoes and Scrabble, using musical notes to form chords. Release planned for September 2014.

Major tasks left to complete:
-----------------------------

+ Connect scene views to game logic (currently written in Ruby!)
+ Create content for main page child view controllers (Help, Options, and so forth)
+ Integrate with Game Center and Store Kit
+ Polish visual design
+ Sound files (to be provided by [Yair Szarf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yairszarf))

Read the [game rules](http://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Dyadminoes_rules_080712.pdf) here. And here's the [tabletop prototype](http://bobtailyearlings.com/docs/Dyadminoes_tabletop_prototype.jpg) I made before learning to code!
